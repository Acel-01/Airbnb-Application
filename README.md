The code is a serializer class in Django Rest Framework. I am most proud of this particular piece of code becaue it taught me a lot. I learnt how to:
- add serializer fields from another model in a model serializer
- loop through data received from the frontend before saving them
- converting files to a base64 string and vice-versa
- despite knowing about it for a while, I used try and except for the first time here
- saving data in multiple models(tables) with a single post request
